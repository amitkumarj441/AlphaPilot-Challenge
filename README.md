# AlphaPilot - Lockheed Martin AI Drone Racing Innovation Challenge

Lockheed Martin and DRL are challenging teams to develop an AI-enabled framework, powered by the NVIDIA Jetson platform for AI at the edge, that can navigate a fully autonomous drone through complex, multi-dimensional racing courses – without any pre-programming or human intervention. 

Teams will develop AI that has an accurate representation of a drone operator’s goals and desires, so it can make inferences about current and future needs, limiting the need for explicit direction. 

This is a competition of AI quality – all other racing variables, including the drone hardware, are controlled.
