ROS packages separate from the flightgoggles catkin workspace. It should be named ‘catkin_ws’ and include the following folders:

   - src – ‘src’ folder should include all source code for the team’s ROS packages
   - devel – the ROS packages should already be compiled into the ‘devel’ folder, the development space, and should include setup.bash (which is usually autogenerated when you build with catkin)
